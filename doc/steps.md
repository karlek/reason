Step 10 - Magic

Add special monster attacks, spells. You don't need all the possible effects right away, just the ones that are needed for the next step.

Step 11 - Simple game

Try to make a simple, hard-coded game. Play it and give it to your friends. Test the mechanics you've implemented so far. See if the game is fun.

Change everything you need to change. Don't forget to test a lot. Always ask someone to test the game's 'fun factor', or test it yourself after a while; it's hard to notice some things right away.

This step should take a pretty long time, until you've got a playable, fun mini-game.

Step 12 - Levels

Write your level generators. Implement moving between the levels, a wilderness and/or town if you want them, saving the levels on level change if you want them to be persistent (so that they don't take up memory).

Spread your monsters and items on different depths. Add more monsters and items, with their effects, as needed.

Step 13 - Experience

Start developing your experience system and skill system. Tune the monsters' and items' stats. Make character generation screen, classes, races, and whatever else you need.

Playtest your game frequently.

Step 14 - Citizens

Add NPCs, shopkeepers, and simple quests if you need them. Keep adding features and tuning the stats.

Step 15 - Free at last

Start adding and testing all the 'unique' features you thought were so cool months (years?) ago, when you started the whole thing. Revise your opinions of them and see if they fit the game.

Write your pet random plot generator, factions system, infinite wilderness generator, neural network AI, or other unique feature, since you can now test it in a working game.
